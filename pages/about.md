# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I grew up in Venezuela, surrounded by a vibrant multicultural community that shaped my fluency in both English and Spanish. During my free time, you'll find me enjoying bowling, tinkering with cars, and playing soccer. Fishing is my way of finding peace and connecting with nature. Fuelled by an unquenchable curiosity, I'm constantly exploring emerging technologies and delving into thought-provoking books to expand my knowledge. Life is a journey I embrace with a positive mindset, seeing challenges as opportunities for personal growth. Collaboration, empathy, and an open mind are values I cherish, as they foster meaningful connections and broaden my perspectives.
